		README for vxge net-snmp agent module
		=====================================

1. GENERAL:
   --------
	This document covers the installation and configuration of Neterion's
	vxge agent for net-snmp.

2. INSTALLATION:
   -------------
	2.1 Dependency:
		1) A latest version of net-snmp library and user command-tools 
                   are need to be installed.
                2) SNMP supported vxge linux device driver. The driver has to 
                   be compiled with VXGE_SNMP macro for enabling it. On loading
                   the driver, it will create two proc files, 'base' and 
                   'dev_table' in /proc/net/vxge/ directory.

        2.2 Build:
                The agent can be compiled and installed by,
                        cd agent;
                        make clean all; 
                        make install;
                Please note the installed directories of mib files and agent
                module.
		
3. CONFIGURATION:
   --------------
        Mainly net-snmp module has 3 configuration files, snmp.conf, snmpd.conf
        and snmptrapd.conf. If any of these files are not yet created, 
        'snmpconf' cammand tool can assist you to set up these file using an 
        interactive session. The following modification is required,

        3.1 mib file configuration:
                1) Add the following lines to snmp.conf file
                        mibs +Neterion-MIB
                        mibs +Neterion-vxge-MIB

        3.2 agent configuration:
                1) vxge agent has to be configured for dynamic loading. Add the
                   below lines to snmpd.conf
                        view systemview included .1.3.6.1.4.1.12808.1.2
                        dlmod vxge /usr/local/vxge/vxge.so

        3.3 trap configuration:
                vxge agent supports notification of traps. We need to configure
                the traphandle in file snmptrapd.conf. An example is given,

                traphandle 1.3.6.1.4.1.12808.1.2.2.1.1.3 /usr/local/vxge/up.sh
                traphandle 1.3.6.1.4.1.12808.1.2.2.1.1.4 /usr/local/vxge/down.sh
                
		The scripts up.sh and down.sh will be executed whenever a trap 
                is received for link up or link down state respectively. The 
                scripts can be written for logging a message to a temporary 
                file.

4. TESTING:
   --------
        The below are some hands-on commands to verify the configuration and 
        run the snmp commands. We should start the daemons 'snmpd' and 
        'snmptrapd' before executing the below commands.
        
        1) mib verification:
                snmp command 'snmptranslate' can read the vxge mib objects, 
                if the mib files are properly loaded. For eg:
		#for listing the OID of vxge object
                >>snmptranslate -IR -Td vxge
                #list all the objects in a tree 
                >>snmptranslate -IR -Tp vxge

        2) snmp get and set operations:
                These commands require the community string to be configured.

                A sample configuration to be modified in snmpd.conf file.
                        #configure community string 'public' for read ops
                        #with local host address
                        rocommunity public 127.0.0.1
                        #configure community string 'private' write  read ops
                        #with local host address
                        rocommunity private 127.0.0.1

                From command prompt, execute the following commands,
                #get the value for object vxge base driver name.
                snmpget -v 2c -c public 127.0.0.1 vxgeBDName.0
                #set the object 'trap enable' for enabling traps
                snmpget -v 2c -c private 127.0.0.1 vxgeDTEnable.0 i 1

        3) Dump all the vxge objects:
                snmpwalk -v 2c -c public 127.0.0.1 vxge

5. TROUBLE-SHOOTING:
   -----------------
        net-snmp will log all error messages normally to /var/log/net-snmpd.log.
        It is recommended to monitor this file from a terminal while setting up
        the vxge agent for the first time
                >>tail -f /var/log/net-snmpd.log
